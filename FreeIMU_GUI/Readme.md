# Kyneo MARG sensors operation calibration.

Uses "FreeIMU_serial" sketch, to be uploaded to Kyneo. Included here, but also into the examples folder of FreeIMU library.

FreeIMU_GUI is been tested in Python 2.7.11 and needs from the following Python packages:

	- pyOpenGL 	(to install it from command window: pip install pyOpenGL)
	- pyserial 	(to install it from command window: pip install pyserial)
	- numpy 	(to install it from command window: pip install numpy)
	- pyOpenGL-accelerate (Can be downloaded from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOpenGL-accelerate/3.1.0b2)
	- pyqt4 	(Can be downloaded from: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs)
	- scipy 	(Can be downloaded from: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs)
	
Important: During the Python installation process, it's neccessary to add the last element of the installation list (disabled by default), so the python executable file is included in the "path".
