The folders included side by side with this file that you'll need to use are:

Arduino_Sketch: Contains a copy of the example Sketch "FreeIMU_serial". You should have it included in the FreeIMU library
 package, anyway.

FreeIMU_GUI: Contains the python executable "cal_gui", which should be launched to present the dashboard with which we'll be able 
execute the Kyneo MARG calibration proccess.
